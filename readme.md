Implementation of REST APIs using Anypoint Studio and MuleSoft.

Used MuleSoft API designer tool for creating and testing demo APIs. Build API specifications with RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML). Designed APIs according to best practices with a context-aware shelf.

After Testing the APIs published them into Anypoint exchange. Anypoint Exchange provides the benefit of being able to discover, share, and incorporate assets and resources into your applications. Anypoint Exchange helps you create API developer portals, view and test APIs, simulate data to APIs (Mocking Service), create assets, and use API Notebooks to describe and test API functions

Open Anypoint studio and create a new mule project and import the API implementation from Anypoint exchange.

Created tables within MySQL database.

Implemented the complete flows for REST API.
